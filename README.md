# SoftPWM
A place I go to calm myself down and code.

## This is the idea
So, I don't exactly have a reason to be opening this account, my code is not exactly great, but I do love coding, I guess that for the first few times I will try to do the Euler Project Challenges, the ones that I find interesting, I suppose that will be fun.

--The first one is challenge 12, What is the first triangle number with more than 500 divisors?--

For some reason I really can't decide if I want to keep using sublime or start using atom, I mean, both of them are exactly the same, atom has git integration, and sublime has easy package managing.

Or at least that's how they feel.

So, now I will try to understand how the hell does the software PWM function works in the cusco, I have a sample code for it, in the folder inside the project, when i figure out how it works I'll write a song for the buzzer on the board.
